About the Project
There are many great projects out there but I wanted to make something I would be passionate about.
I realized at the highest level of badminton play - badminton world championships and olympics,
there is a requirement for someone to control the score. An Arduino and a scorekeeper is required,
a finger on a button to manually add the score for each of the players. The code prevents erroneous outputs.

The question is how would I translate the score onto the user interface spectators watching at home? 
What if I expanded this project into a machine learning project where the project learns the game of 
badminton and keeps track of the score. This already sounds complicated...
What if i take it one step further and analyze player mistakes??

Some of the challenges
   - Understanding when a call is challenged and provide the correct result
   - How would the system recognize which player got the point
   - When does the play end?
   - Interference calls - point being replayed
   - End game score at 30
   - Best out of 3
   - Game point at 21 with no deuces

Ideas to start

1. Start with Frontend React Application
2. Make Frontend, backend, and ai application.
