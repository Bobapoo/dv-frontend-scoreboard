About the Project
There are many great projects out there but I wanted to make something I would be passionate about.
I realized at the highest level of badminton play - badminton world championships and olympics,
there is a requirement for someone to control the score. An Arduino and a scorekeeper is required,
a finger on a button to manually add the score for each of the players. The code prevents erroneous outputs.

The question is how would I translate the score onto the user interface spectators watching at home? 
What if I expanded this project into a machine learning project where the project learns the game of 
badminton and keeps track of the score. This already sounds complicated...

Some of the challenges
   - Understanding when a call is challenged and provide the correct result
   - How would the system recognize which player got the point
   - When does the play end?
   - Interference calls - point being replayed
   - End game score at 30
   - Best out of 3
   - Game point at 21 with no deuces

Ideas to start
1. Pick the technologies - increase difficulty by using unfamilliar tech stack
2. Lets make sure the code can count the score correctly
3. Work on the controller
4. Then slowly replace the controller with screen capture abilities
5. Cover case by case on court
6. Implement unit and integration testing
7. Use it / QA testing?!?!
8. Repeat steps 5-7 until production ready
